# DKB-Broker

DKB-Broker kind of sucks in terms of information provided on your performance and money. I am writing this script to provide the following information:

## Features

- performance for set intervals (monthly p/l, weekly p/l... etc.)
- total spent in fees and in set intervals
- total dividens collected
- portfolio analysis (https://github.com/ssantoshp/Empyrial)
- diversification analysis of the portfolio
- I am sure I'll think of more as time goes on.

## TODO

- [ ] get inbox messages with Selenium
- [ ] parse_buys (did most of the parsing work just gotta finish up)
- [ ] parse_sales (did most of the parsing work just gotta finish up)
- [ ] parse_info (did most of the parsing work just gotta finish up)
- [ ] parse_cancel (did most of the parsing work just gotta finish up)
- [ ] parse_dividend (did most of the parsing work just gotta finish up)
- [ ] Dashboard
- [ ] Database (just gonna do it with Django)
